          <p class="bio col-xs-12">I'm a print and web designer based in Austin, TX. My design aesthetic favors simplicity and ease of use in conjunction with bright, clean colors and linear forms. I have always been drawn to narrative and try to use design as a vehicle for storytelling, wether that story is text-based or client-based. I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of design and also spent a year in the Master of Architecture program at the University of Michigan. Outside of design work, I am a published poet and like to relax with knitting and podcasts.

Similarly, the extreme act of sensory deprivation is reflected in the stark colors and forms. The second illustration is one of three panels that depicts a whimsical scene, which was generated from  the random subjects of a cul-de-sac, equestrian horse jumping, and the styling of TeamLab's <em>Flower and Corpse Glitch Set</em>, which features a digital wireframe cloud.

We often think of domestic spaces as inherently safe, a haven from the anxiety of the outside world. Instead, I sought to reveal the latent discomfort of interior spaces and the possibility of a reciprocal relationship between psychology and space. The white wall has three hidden peep holes and is both perorated and inaccessible. The two tub spouts are made of frozen milk, both a symbol of night time comfort and a strange material of its own right. As the exhibition continues, the milk spouts begin to melt, allowing the milk to pool and run beneath the white barrier.</p>
